## More about me

I am from [Yugan](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E4%BD%99%E5%B9%B2%E5%8E%BF) in Jiangxi Provice, which is a small yet beautiful county near Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. 
I earned my Ph.D. degree at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in Oct. 2013, under the instructions of Prof. [Tiejun Zhao](http://encs.hit.edu.cn/2016/0229/c5511a144140/page.htm) at HIT and Dr. [Taro Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/site/tarowtnb/) at NICT. After that, I was a postdoc researcher at the City University of New York, working with Prof. [Liang Huang](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~huanlian/); I was a researcher at NICT Japan working with [Masao Utiyama](https://www2.nict.go.jp/astrec-att/member/mutiyama/) between Sept. 2014 and March 2017; and
I was a principal researcher at Tencent working with [Guoping Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xSkkA7UAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Shuming Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lg31AKMAAAAJ&hl=en) until Oct. 2025.
